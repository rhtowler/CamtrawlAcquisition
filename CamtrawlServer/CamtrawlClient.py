CamtrawlClient.py

CamtrawlClient provides a client side interface for the CamTrawl
server and is used to monitor and control a CamTrawl system over a
network connection.


"Public" methods

connectToServer(host address, port)
disconnectFromServer()
getImage(camera, compressed=False, scale=100, quality=80)
setData(sensorID, data, asyncSensor=False, time=None)
getData(sensorID=None)
getParameter(module, parameter)
setParameter(module, parameter, value)


Qt Signals:

connected()

The connected signal is emitted when the client successfully connects
with the server. Any calls to getImage(), getData(), etc. before the
client is connected will be ignored so you must wait until this signal
is received before sending and requests.


disconnected()

The disconnected signal is emitted when the client disconnects from the
server. This can be after a call to disconnectFromServer() or if the server
disconnects the client.


error([int] errorNumber, [string] errorString)

The error signal is emitted when there is an error. Usually the errors will
be related to the socket (unable to connect/timeout etc.)

    errorNumber     - an int containing the errorNumber. When the error is
                      socket related, it will be the QAbstractSocket::SocketError
                      value. Non-socket errors will have a made up error number
                      which really isn't thought out well.

    errorString     - a string containing a message that descripes the error.


imageData([string] camera, [str] label, [dict] imageData)

The imageData signal is emitted when an image from a camera has been
received and decoded. The signal will be emitted once for each camera
you request an image from.

    camera          - a string containing the camera name the image belongs to.

    label           - a string containing the camera label

    imageData       - a dict in the following form containing the image data and
                      metadata with the following keys:

                        imageData['data'] - image data as OpenCV numpy array
                        imageData['ok'] - True if image was received, False if there was a problem
                        imageData['exposure'] - camera exposure
                        imageData['gain'] - camera gain
                        imageData['height'] - image height
                        imageData['width'] - image width
                        imageData['timestamp'] - trigger timestamp
                        imageData['filename'] - image filename (if any)
                        imageData['image_number'] - global image number

                      imageData['data'] is a numpy array (height, width, depth)
                      and will typically be of dtype 'uint8' (theoretical support
                      for 'uint16' data exists but is not tested.) The depth will
                      be 1 for mono images and 3 for color images. The pixel order
                      is BGR and suitable for use with OpenCV but may need to be
                      converted before using with other image processing libraries.



dataReceived([string] sensorID, [dict] sensorData)

The dataReceived signal is emitted when data from a getData() request has been
received an decoded.

    def getImage(self, camera, compressed=False, scale=100, quality=80):
        '''
        getImage sends an image request to the server for the specified camera.

        You can request an image from a single camera, or from multiple cameras at the
        same time. If you are requesting images from multiple cameras and need your images
        to be synced (same frame number for each image) you must provide the camera
        names as a list. While you can request images from multiple cameras independently
        (i.e. call getImage twice, passing each camera name as a string) you may or
        may not get synced images.

        The server stores the most recently acquired image from each camera and sends it
        when it receives a request. Once sent, it will queue a request from the same client
        for the same camera until a new image is acquired by the camera at which time it
        will send it. In practice this means that you can design consumers that follow a
        simple pattern where you request an image then enter a process->request loop.

        There is 1 case where the request queuing behavior is different. If you request
        an image from camera A, receive it, then request images from camera A and camera B,
        the server will immediately resend camera A's image (and then B's image), even if it
        hasn't received a new image from camera A. This is done to ensure the images are
        synced.

        The client will emit the imageReceived signal, once for each requested camera, as
        the images are received.

        camera (str or list)    As string, the name of the camera you are requesting an image from.

                                Example: 'Blackfly BFLY-PGE-50S5M_17219622'

                                As list, a list of camera strings. An image will be requested
                                from each camera in the list. This method ensures the images
                                will be synced (same frame number.)

                                ['Blackfly BFLY-PGE-50S5M_17219622', 'Blackfly BFLY-PGE-50S5M_17219631']

                                Requests for cameras that are unknown to the server will be
                                ignored.

        compressed (bool)       Set to True to have the server encode the image data as
                                a jpeg before sending. This reduces the amount of data
                                sent over the wire at the cost of CPU utilization. The
                                client will decode the image upon receipt. Set the
                                'quality' keyword to specify the level of compression.

        scale (int)             Set scale to a value between 1 and 100 to scale the
                                image before sending. A value of 50 will scale it 50%
                                both vertically and horizontally are result in an image
                                that is 1/4 the original size. This can be used to reduce
                                bandwidth utilization.

        quality (int)           Set quality to a value between 1 and 99 to set the JPEG
                                encoding quality. Values above ~98 will result in images
                                that are larger than the source image. This only has an
                                effect when compressed=True.  A reasonable value is in the
                                range of 65-85 though YMMV.

        setData will inject NMEA0183 style data into the CamtrawlAcquisition sensor data
        stream. Data from the sensor data stream is written to the acquisition
        metadata SQLLite file. Camtrawl has 2 types of sensors. synchronous sensors provide
        data that is recorded when the cameras are triggered. This data is stored in the
        sensor_data table and is keyed by image number. Examples are GPS location,
        camera depth, camera orientation. Asynchronous sensors are sensors that aren't
        directly tied to an image and are typically recorded at a much lower rate. These
        data are written to the async_data table and are keyed by time only. Synced data is
        written to the database when the cameras are next triggered. Async data is written
        immediately to the database. Sensor specifics are configured in the "sensor"
        section of the acquisition applications configuration file.

        data (str or list)      A string or list of strings containing the NMEA 0183 like
                                message(s). The strings do not have to strictly conform to the
                                NMEA 0183 standard, but should be provided as a comma delimited
                                string in the form:

                                    header_id, data

                                where header_id uniquely identifies the data contained in the data
                                string.

        time (datetime)         Set to a datetime object representing the time the data was
                                generated or received. This only has an effect on asynchronous
                                sensor data which is tagged with the provided time and logged
