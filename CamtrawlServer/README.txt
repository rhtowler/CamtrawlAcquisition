The ODroid XU4 32-bit Ubuntu 20.04 OS image is running protobuf 3.6.1
and the Rpi 4 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 OS image and my Windows 10 dev environment
are running protobuf 3.18.0.

The XU4 OS has some dependency issue with newer protobuf versions so it is
running the older version. Make sure the correct version of CamtrawlServer_pb2.py
is active on your platform.
