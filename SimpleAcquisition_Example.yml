# If a configuration parameter defined below is commented or missing, the default value
# will be used. Defaults are defined at the top of SimpleAcquisition.py
#

#  specify some general application settings
application:

    # Set the mode of collection.
    #
    # The Camtrawl platform defines one on/off cycle as a deployment. Traditionally, data from
    # a deployment would be written to a directory named after the date and time the system
    # was powered on. This works well when each on/off cycle is a separate deployment, such
    # as when a camera system is deployed on a net during a trawl. Data for that deployment
    # is contained within the single folder
    #
    # But, this doesn't make sense for long term deployments where the camera system
    # is turned on and off periodically to collect a few images. In these cases, the deployment
    # is not a single on/off event so it is not desirable to log data to a separate folder each
    # time the system is powered on.
    #
    # The output_mode can be used to specify how data are organized when collected to
    # support both of these use cases:
    #
    #    Set output_mode to "separate" to collect data in separate folders for each on/off
    #    cycle. This is the traditional Camtrawl behavior. In this case, output_path will define
    #    where these deployment folders will be written. For example, if output_path is set
    #    to c:\data, the application will create deployment folders below that like
    #    c:\data\D20210101-T120024
    #
    #    Set output_mode to "combined" to collect data in a single folder for each on/off
    #    cycle. In this case, output_path defines the single folder where all data will be written.
    #    When the system powers on in combined mode, it determines how many existing
    #    images have been collected, updates the image counter, and adds additional images
    #    to the specified directory.
    output_mode: separate

    #  Define the path to the directory where the data will be written. The data directories
    #  will automatically be created within this directory.
    #output_path: /camtrawl/image_data
    output_path: C:/camtrawl/data

    #  specify the name of the SQLite metadata database file.
    database_name: CamtrawlMetadata.db3

    # You can control the amount of info that is output to the log, also known as the log level.
    # This can be set, in increasing verboseness, to ERROR, WARNING, INFO, or DEBUG. Normally
    # you would set this to INFO.
    log_level: INFO

    # Set shut_down_on_exit to True to have the application shut the computer down when the
    # application exits. This is the normal behavior for a deployed Camtrawl system. This
    # can be disabled for testing.
    shut_down_on_exit:  False

    # Set the path to the directory containing the ffmpeg executable used to encode video
    # files. Leave this empty to use the ffmpeg found on the system PATH. Typically this
    # will be blank but if Windows users have not added ffmpeg to their PATH, they can set
    # the path here. Relative paths will be converted to absolute paths using the
    # CamtrawlAcquisition directory as the base.
    #
    # Most linux systems have ffmpeg in their package repositories. Windows users can
    # download binaries from https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

    #  Windows users can download ffmpeg and unzip it in the ffmpeg folder in the
    #  CamtrawlAcquisition directory:

    #  Set disk_free_monitor to True to have the acquisition application periodically check
    #  the disk free space and stop acquiring if the free space drops below the specified
    #  minimum value in megabytes. Completely filling a disk can cause issues with camera
    #  operation and it is advised to enable this feature. If omitted, the default value
    #  is True.

#  specify some details about how fast and how many times cameras should be triggered
acquisition:

    # Specify the camera triggering rate in TRIGGERS PER SECOND. Note that the realized
    # acquisition rate for each camera may be affected by camera specific settings. The
    # upper end of the trigger rate will depend on the speed of the acquisition PC. If
    # the commanded rate is higher than the rate the hardware can support, the realized
    # rate will be whatever the hardware can do.
    #
    # Example values:     5 = 5 images per second
    #                   0.5 = 1 image every 2 seconds
    #                0.0167 = 1 image per minute
    trigger_rate: 5

    # Specify the number of triggers that should be generated by the application before
    # exiting. Set to -1 to trigger indefinitely. Note that the global trigger counter
    # is used when determining if the trigger limit has been met. Camera specific settings
    # may result in fewer images being recorded.
    trigger_limit: 500


# The Camtrawl server provides a command and control interface and serves up image and
# sensor data on the network. It can be used in conjunction with the Camtrawl client in
# applications for remote viewing and control of the system.

    start_server: True

#  The sensors section contains configuration details for the handling of sensor data.
#  The acquisition application can log NMEA-0183 like serial data from local devices,
#  network ports, or RFC2217 compatible serial servers. The data must be comma
#  delimited ASCII text terminated by \n or \n\r and the first field should uniquely
#  identify the data.
#
#  Data can be logged in sync with the images, where the most recent data will be
#  written at the same time the cameras are triggered, and it can also be logged
#  at the time it is received or asynchronously. Synced data is written to the 
#  metadata database sensor_data table and async data is written to the
#  async_data table. Data in the sensor_data table is logged with the image number
#  it is synced with and data in the async_data table includes the time the data was
#  received.
#
#  You can also send data to sensors (via CamtrawlServer) to operate polled sensors
#  or other devices.

    #  if the default is to log data synchronously or asynchronously.

# Define the individual camera parameters
cameras:

    # The acquisition application will first look for camera specific settings that
    # are in sections defined using the camera name and serial number (for example
    # Chameleon3 CM3-U3-50S5M_16306616). If a camera specific setting is found, the
    # settings in that section will be used to configure that camera.
    #
    # If a camera specific section cannot be found for a specific camera, the "default"
    # section will be used for that camera. If no default section exists either, that
    # camera will not be configured and will be ignored by the application.

    # The default camera properties are applied if a specific camera entry cannot be
    # found. The "default" section is not required and is normally omitted in deployed
    # systems but it is included here to ensure that the the application can acquire
    # images with minimal initial configuration.

        # that are combined. The upper limit will depend on your camera, but typical values are:
        #
        #    1 - no binning. Image is acquired at full resolution
        #    2 - 2x2 binning for an image that is 1/4 the original size
